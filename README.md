Welcome to my portfolio!

The goal of this portfolio is to practice new technologies, solve challenges, and demonstrate my knowledge in certain areas and tools. It serves as a showcase of my skills and projects.

## Introduction

This portfolio is a collection of projects that I have worked on to enhance my skills and knowledge in various technologies. Each project focuses on a specific area or tool, allowing me to explore and demonstrate my expertise.

## Technologies Used

Throughout this portfolio, I have utilized a range of technologies, frameworks, and libraries. Some of the key technologies used include:

- Python: For data analysis, scripting, and backend development.
- Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- Power BI: A suite of business analytics tools for data visualization and reporting. Each report generated will be published on [my personal blog](https://mgpportfolio.blogspot.com/).
- PySpark: The Python API for Apache Spark, enabling big data processing and analysis.

## Folder Structure

The portfolio follows a specific folder structure to ensure organization and reproducibility. Here is an overview of the main folders and their purposes:

- `01_aux_files/`: This folder contains auxiliary files such as data sources, query results, Power BI themes, and images used in the projects.
    - `img/`: Contains images used in the portfolio, divided into project folders.
    - `Power BI Themes/`: Stores generated Power BI themes and pbit files for reuse.
    - `Results/`: Stores the results of queries, divided by project folders. Subfolders may be used to further categorize results.
    - `Source/`: Contains data sources, divided into project folders.

- `02_Projects/`: Each project folder contains:
    - `readme.md` file or an explanation of the challenge or project.
    - Subfolders for each technology used.

## Projects

The portfolio consists of several projects, each focusing on a specific area or tool. Each project has its own folder within the `02_Projects/` folder. Additional information about each project can be found in the respective project's folders.

## Results

Depending on the nature of the challenge or project, you will be able to find the results in different locations:
- `01_aux_files/results`: If it's a file such as a .csv, .xlsx, .parquet, etc.
- [My personal blog](https://mgpportfolio.blogspot.com/): I will publish every dashboard on my blog. Each blog post will consist of a specific project.

## Ending

Feel free to explore the projects and their contents. They are designed to demonstrate my skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of the technologies used.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you find it informative and inspiring.
